- Alternating symbols (X and 0) are now working in correspondance with turn count
- X and 0 are now different colors
- Print out winner based on top horizontal line (testing)
    - Issue with check_lines function not accepting 'X' as boolean value.
    This was because the use of colored() in the insertion method made the character inserted
    into an object rather than a string. Therefore, bool couldn't math string. Rather, had to make 
    value_O and value_X globals and assign to conditional in check_lines()
