- Alternating symbols (X and 0) are now working in correspondance with turn count
- X and 0 are now different colors
- Print out winner based on top horizontal line (testing)
    - Issue with check_lines function not accepting 'X' as boolean value.
    This was because the use of colored() in the insertion method made the character inserted
    into an object rather than a string. Therefore, bool couldn't math string. Rather, had to make 
    value_O and value_X globals and assign to conditional in check_lines()

- Issues:
    - check_lines():
        - user input has to follow the 'if' conditional order set in code. E.g if user input is in sections
        0,2 --> Winner will be announced due to execution bypassing the 1 conditional.
- Solution:
    - Was being really stupid. Replaced and with == --> Problem solved. Duh!
